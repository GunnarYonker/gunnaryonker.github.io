Hey there! I'm Gunnar Yonker, a cybersecurity professional based in the heart of Wisconsin. With a passion for protecting digital landscapes and a love for problem-solving I can't wait to break into the field.

# Who Am I?
I'm not just another individual after a career in cybersecurity. I recently completed a Master's degree in Cybersecurity from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater with an emphasis in Security Engineering in which I learned skills in threat detection, incident response, and security engineering. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, showcasing my diverse academic background and adaptability.

# What Sets Me Apart?
My professional journey speaks volumes about my commitment to excellence. My background is diverse as I am starting my switch into the cybersecurity field after working in the Biochemistry field. I have developed great leadership skills through coaching high school soccer that will allow me to not only be a great leader but also a team player.

# Why Cybersecurity?
From a young age, I've been interested in the intricate workings of technology. For me, cybersecurity isn't just a professionâ€”it's a lifelong fascination and a chance to contribute to a more resilient cyber world.

My educational journey, from breaking into Ethical Hacking to learning Malware Reverse Engineering, reflects my diverse interest in understanding and confronting digital threats head-on. Each class has been a stepping stone in my path to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology with confidence and expertise.

In a world where technology is constantly evolving, cybersecurity offers me the opportunity to continue learning and growing. With every challenge comes the chance to innovate, adapt, and contribute to a safer digital environment for all.
